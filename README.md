This repository contains online materials relating to the project "HADAMARD MATRICES IN CENTRALISER ALGEBRAS OF MONOMIAL REPRESENTATIONS" 

MonRep.pdf is a copy of our preprint
MonRepCode.m is MAGMA code for working centralisers of monomial representations 

Rank3 and Rank4 contain machine output related to constructing Complex Hadamard matrices invariant under primitive monomial groups of ranks 3 and 4. 
This repository will be updated periodically between now and the end of 2024.
